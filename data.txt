ÒI commented on your fangsÓ
Don Mills and Sheppard (m4w)
ÒAt 10:15pm on Saturday, November 4th, I spoke to you in the middle of the crosswalk at Don Mills and Sheppard. I noticed your teeth, I commented on your fangs, you gave me a smile, I drove off as you walked away to get onto the TTC. As I drove away, I was blown away by your smile and I want to know more about you. Message me, so I can know more about you.Ó
 

ÒLiterally I just wanna down shots, play Jenga and chillÓ
(m4w)
ÒI was going to e-mail you, but then POOF! Your post was gone. My guess is that you were overwhelmed by the responses you received and/or immediately suffered CCER (Craigslist Casual Encounters RemorseÉ I hope youÕre recovering well!) Nonetheless, I too have an affinity for cognac and am partial to whiskey. IÕd really be interested to see if we could take on Kim Jong-il for the Hennessy consumption record. IÕm so down to play Jenga, but my only condition is that we play for ÒWorld ChampionÓ bragging rights! Ever been to Snakes & Lattes?

Sincerely,
Shot in the DarkÓ
 

ÒYou: Dressed up as Billy the Puppet from SawÒ
Falcon and Firkin, Richmond Hill (m4w)
ÒYou: Dressed up as Billy the Puppet from Saw, looking absolutely amazing.
Me: Absolutely mesmerized by you.
You were standing in front of me and I was sitting in the booth directly behind you wearing a hat turned back with the word ÒLOVEÓ stitched on it. IÕm hoping you or someone that knows you reads this and can give me any info as to who you are and if youÕre single. Our eyes locked on each other quite a few times and I wanted to introduce myself. IÕd love to connect with you. Tell me what costume the DJ was wearing so that I know itÕs you.Ó
 

ÒPenguin WomanÓ
Bay Adelaide Centre parking garage (m4w)
ÒI thought about you a few times yesterday. I wish I had the good sense to stop and talk a little more, or offer to carry your penguin. You are a jaw-dropping fox.Ó

you: serving the table behind mine at Paupers Pub tonight, 7:45pmish, short haircut that's longer on top, glasses, small septum ring, black docs or blundstones probably

me: blonde with pink glasses, septum piercing, dressed in black and floral, waved the dad over who couldn't find our table and had asked you for help

Thought you were immensely cute. I wasn't going to approach you at work (or realistically, ever in real life because I'm a big baby) but I thought we potentially made eye contact a few times and might be worth extending it to the internet!

(In case you somehow see this and you're interested & available, I was having dinner with my partner and her parents - so if non-monogamy isn't your thing then I'll just wish you well and tell you you're flawless!)On the 505 Dundas bus today just before noon, you were the man in a black punk jacket, with blue eyes, a septum piercing, a hot pink fringe in your hair, and a neck tattoo that I think said Òdie strongÓ.
You spoke of the police with a charming distain, and smiled while reminiscing about the drunk tank.
You are hands down the most gorgeous human my parents could ever disapprove of and if I had a time machine, IÕd go back and find you just so I could bring you home for Christmas dinner.
Not totally sure youÕre single, but you are absolute perfection.

To everyone who has ever smiled at me, met my eyes with theirs, reached out in a strange and moving way, let me airdrop them a poem, made me feel less alone walking down the streetÑ thank you for being everything that makes going through this easier.

To all those who turn away, be well and take the care I have for you.

HereÕs to chance, connection, and the complicated reasons that we find it difficult to trust each other, to be open and vulnerableÑ may we all find connection in the way that makes us feel most safe.

You:
Asian woman probably late 20s/ early 30s.
Dark blue puffer coat.
Blackish/grayish jeans
Boots
Beige mits with finger holes.
Long black hair.
No makeup.
Thin and short (probably 5'4" ish)
Idgaf swag.
Legs very wide, woman-spreading massively in the middle seat of the blue accessible flip down seats. Normally not great, but the subway was really empty.
Bobbing your head to music (assuming rap?)
You seemed a bit antsy like you were in a rush or agitated or just really wanted to get to where you were going. Impatiently scrolled through insta briefly.
You got off at St. Andrew around 10 minutes to 7pm.

Me: I was the femme, medium length blonde hair, blue head phones in the navy coat with tortoise shell and yellow glasses. I got on at Queen and sat facing you in the seats next to the blue flip down seats you were sitting in.
I got major queer vibes. Are you single?
You look like just the gay I've been looking for to fuck up my life.
